# Max Polygon Packing with Genetic Algorithm

## Project Overview

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Max Polygon Packing problem. The objective is to maximize the value of polygons packed within a container without overlapping and without allowing rotations. The algorithm uses a JSON input format that specifies the shapes, their coordinates, values, and the container's dimensions.

## Algorithm Explanation

The core of this project is a Genetic Algorithm that evolves a population of solutions over multiple generations. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The algorithm starts with a random population of solutions. Each solution is a specific arrangement of shapes in the container.

2. **Selection**: 
   - The best solutions are selected based on their fitness, which is determined by the total value of shapes successfully placed in the container.

3. **Crossover**: 
   - New solutions are generated by combining parts of two parent solutions, mimicking biological crossover.

4. **Mutation**: 
   - Changes are introduced to some solutions to maintain diversity in the population and avoid local optima.

5. **Termination**: 
   - The algorithm continues to evolve the population until a predefined number of generations is reached or a satisfactory solution is found.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`main.py`**: The entry point for running the algorithm. It parses arguments, sets up logging, and initializes the algorithm.
- **`algo.py`**: Contains the base classes and utility functions used by the genetic algorithm.
- **`genetic_algo.py`**: Implements the specific genetic algorithm used to solve the problem.
- **`Container.py`**: Defines the container where the shapes will be packed.
- **`Shape.py`**: Defines the shapes that need to be packed.
- **`Solution.py`**: Represents a solution, including the arrangement of shapes within the container.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions for loading input files and other helper methods.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/max-polygon-packing.git
   cd max-polygon-packing
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the algorithm, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --instance path/to/instance.json --pop_size 4 --gens 5 --tries 10
```

### Arguments:
- `--instance`: Path to the JSON file containing the problem instance.
- `--pop_size`: (Optional) Population size for the genetic algorithm. Default is 4.
- `--gens`: (Optional) Number of generations for the genetic algorithm. Default is 5.
- `--tries`: (Optional) Number of tries for random creation. Default is 10.

### Example

You can run an example instance as follows:

```bash
python main.py --instance data/example.json --pop_size 10 --gens 100 --tries 20
```

## Examples

Example JSON instances are provided in the `data` directory. You can modify these or create new ones to test different scenarios.
