# Second batch of examples (2023-08-16)

We got some feedback, and here are some more examples.
We recommend ignoring the first batch, and start with this one as it will be much closer to the actual benchmark.

Significant changes:

* Objects are now more uniformly sized, though there are some parameters. The tiny objects in the first batch were just annoying without increasing the difficulty, so we removed them.
* jigsaw now also with larger instances.
* A new generator "atris".

You still have the chance to give us some feedback, and we will try to incorporate it.
